## How to Use
Thanks to ImGui user can dynamically add texts, edit position, color, blur amount, text shadowing. User can also activate a cool RainCode demo to measure performance or font rendering quality. To edit TextLines, just right click on it and set the parameters.
## Running of the Prototype
To run the prototype, go to bin folder and double click on the executable. All necessary TTF fonts should be already inside of the bin folder, please do not delete them. After launching the bin, you will be able to edit TextLines dynamically from ImGui.
## Compiling of the Prototype
To compile the prototype, repo contains all the static library without a NuGet package independency. Refer to the “external” folder.
